# C++ OOPS and Algorithms – CS2810 Course Project

This course project, developed under the guidance of **Prof. Rupesh Nasre**, explores Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and algorithmic implementations using **C++**.

## 📌 Overview

The project consists of **13 distinct problem statements**, each focusing on various core algorithmic concepts. These problems are systematically implemented using modern C++ features and OOP principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Implementations include algorithms covering:
  - Graph theory (e.g., Dijkstra’s algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm)
  - Dynamic Programming , Divide and Conquer
  - AVL trees and other data structures
  - Complex number computations
  - Sorting and searching
  - Basic computational geometry
- Each problem is designed and solved using clean, modular, and extensible OOP design.
- Comprehensive test cases were created for validation, including **corner and edge cases**.

## ✅ Purpose

- Demonstrates effective use of Object-Oriented Design in algorithmic problem-solving.
- Reinforces core computer science concepts through hands-on C++ implementations.

## 🧪 Testing

- All modules were tested using a wide variety of input cases.
- Edge cases and boundary scenarios were specifically targeted to ensure robustness and correctness.
